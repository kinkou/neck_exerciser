# Do your neck exercises every day!

## What's this?
This is a hands-free speaking timer for neck strengthening exercises. It measures the time between the exercises and rounds so you don't have to.
You can save it as a webapp on your phone desktop.

## What are the neck strengthening exercises?
They are simple exercises to make your neck muscles stronger.

## Why?
If you often have vertigos or headaches chances are your intervertebral discs got so thin that the blood vessels and nerves inside your neck got affected.
These exercises stimulate the neck muscles to stay in tone, effectively relieving the symptoms.

## Are they effective?
Hell yeah. Start doing these every day and you'll notice the difference in a few days.

## Who says?
The neurologists.

## Ok, how do I use this?
* Exercise 1: Press moderately with your **forehead** against your palm.
* Exercise 2: Press moderately with the **right side of your head** against your palm.
* Exercise 3: Press moderately with the **back of your head** against your palm.
* Exercise 4: Press moderately with the **left side of your head** against your palm.
* **Make sure your neck muscles are tensing up every time!**
* There are 5 rounds. No need to do them all.
* Each exercise takes 30 seconds. One round takes about 2 minutes.

## My hand gets tired quickly!
Mine too. Use a rubber band, a wall, anything. Get creative.
I use a rubber band attached to a pull-up bar and a bag strap with a shoulder pad to make it easy on the head skin and hair.

## How do I start the timer over?
Just reload the page.

## Thank you!
